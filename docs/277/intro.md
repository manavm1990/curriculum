# Ready to Dive Deeper into JS and Web Development?

## Register for CIS 277 - Web Technologies

This course is offered every **fall semester** and is a great way to delve deeper into modern JavaScript and Web Development.

The specific topics covered in this course may vary, but typically the focus is on working with JavaScript on the backend. To this end the technologies covered may include:

- TypeScript - We'll review JavaScript and along the way, introduce TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language (similar to C# or Java). This can help catch errors early in the development process.
- Node.js - a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript outside of the browser, leveraging a computer's operating system to perform tasks. This translates to the ability to create server-side applications using JavaScript.
- Express.js - a web application framework for Node.js that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. This allows us to write a bit less code and get more done as opposed to trying to write everything from scratch in Node.js.
- Fastify - a modern alternative to Express.js that is focused on speed and low overhead.
- PostgreSQL - a powerful, open-source object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads.
- MongoDB - a general-purpose, document-based, distributed database built for modern application developers and for the cloud era.

Primarily, these technologies are used to build RESTful APIs. Optionally, we may also introduce GraphQL, a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries by using a type system you define for your data.

In addition, we will continue to build our skills using tangential web technologies including the shell, Git, and GitHub and writing tests. We'll continue to focus on best practices in software development, writing clean, maintainable code, using code quality tools and AI.
