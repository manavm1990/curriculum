# Ready to Dive Deeper into JS and Web Development?

## Register for CIS 277 - Web Technologies

This course is offered every **fall semester** and is a great way to delve deeper into modern JavaScript and Web Development.

The specific topics covered in this course may vary, but typically the focus is on working with JavaScript libraries and frameworks on the frontend. The focus is on building single-page applications (SPAs) using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. If time allows, we go even further by incorporating a React framework, such as Next.js, to build full-stack applications.

In addition, we will continue to build our skills using tangential web technologies including the shell, Git, and GitHub and writing tests. We'll continue to focus on best practices in software development, writing clean, maintainable code, using code quality tools and AI.
