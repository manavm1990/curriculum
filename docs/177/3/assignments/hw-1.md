# Homework 3-1: Reflect on Your Learning

## What is Reflection?

> Reflection is a process of reviewing an experience of practice in order to describe, analyze, and evaluate and so increase learning from it. It is a form of personal response to experiences, situations, events, or new information. It is a way of clarifying what has happened, what needs to be done, and what you think and feel about it.

## Why Reflect?

Reflecting on your learning is an important part of the learning process. It helps you to think about what you have learned, how you have learned it, and what you can do to improve your learning in the future. It also helps you to think about how you can apply what you have learned to other areas of your life.
