# Installations and Setups - Windows

The videos below will walk you through the process of setting up your development environment. This part of the course is more of a 'follow the leader' format and we are not spending the time here to explain all of these tools. Just follow along as closely as you can and don't worry about understanding everything right now. We will cover all of these tools in detail later on.

The following videos will guide you on this process. Naturally, if you are not
using Windows, you can skip this step.

Note that I am using a Windows emulator on Mac in these videos, and it's a bit tedious and frustrating, so bear with me!

## Step 1: Install Chrome

To ensure consistency, you'll want to use Google Chrome for this class. As an alternative, you could consider [Mozilla Firefox - Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/). However, I'll be using Chrome in this course. If you don't have Chrome installed, you can download it from [here](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

For additional information, follow along with the video below:

<iframe width="100%" height="100%" style={{border: "0", width: "100%",
height: "100%"}}
scrolling="no"

## Step 2: Install Visual Studio Code and Git Bash

Our code editor of choice will be VS Code (NOT Visual Studio for C#). You'll also need Git Bash to run commands in the terminal. **Please refer to the video below as there are some specific settings you'll need** for optimal operation, especially when installing Git Bash. Failure to have these settings could lead to issues later on and will probably waste both of our time.

<div class="sp-embed-player"  data-id="cZVIYdVJ1lz">
<script src="https://go.screenpal.com/player/appearance/cZVIYdVJ1lz"></script>
<iframe width="100%" height="100%" style={{border: "0", width: "100%",
height: "100%"}}
scrolling="no"
src="https://go.screenpal.com/player/cZVIYdVJ1lz?width=100%&height=100%&ff=1" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></div>

## Step 3: GitBash Completion and GitHub Command Line Interface (CLI)

This video outlines **a critical step** to check for whenever you are using GitBash. It also gets you set up with the GitHub CLI.

<div class="sp-embed-player"  data-id="cZVIYRVJ1I5">
<script src="https://go.screenpal.com/player/appearance/cZVIYRVJ1I5"></script>
<iframe width="100%" height="100%" style={{border: "0", width: "100%",
height: "100%"}}
scrolling="no"
src="https://go.screenpal.com/player/cZVIYRVJ1I5?width=100%&height=100%&ff=1" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></div>

## Step 4: About GitHub CLI and Installing GitHub CLI

We use the terms _Terminal,_ _Shell_ and Command Line Interface (CLI) interchangeably. On Windows, whenever you hear me mention one of these terms, I am referring to Git Bash, as far as Windows is concerned.

The video below mentions this and show you how to verify that you have the GitHub CLI installed.

<div class="sp-embed-player" data-id="cZVIr6VJ1oa">
<script src="https://go.screenpal.com/player/appearance/cZVIr6VJ1oa"></script>
<iframe width="100%" height="100%" style={{border: "0", width: "100%",
height: "100%"}}
scrolling="no"
src="https://go.screenpal.com/player/cZVIr6VJ1oa?width=100%&height=100%&ff=1" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></div>

Note that in the video above I mistakenly say that it's the last step. Alas, there is another one!

## Step 5: Install Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript on your computer. We will be using it to run our development server, among other things. You can download Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/). For more information, follow along with the video below:

<div class="sp-embed-player"  data-id="cZVIrDVJ1o8">
<script src="https://go.screenpal.com/player/appearance/cZVIrDVJ1o8"></script>
<iframe width="100%" height="100%" style={{border: "0", width: "100%",
height: "100%"}}
scrolling="no"
