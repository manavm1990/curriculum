## Before Getting Started

Before starting this assignment, you will need to have a GitHub account. If you don't have one, you can [create one](https://github.com/).

Just look for this "Sign Up" button in the top right ![GitHub screenshot](/img/sign-up.png)

When you sign up, you will need to use an ✉️ address. You can use whatever you like, but I recommend that you use your school email address. The reason why is that this may help you unlock some free features on GitHub. You can always add other identifying emails later.

Once you have your GitHub username, **please send it to your instructor.** You will be invited to join a GitHub Team for your class.

**Optional but Recommended:** You should [apply for GitHub Education.](https://docs.github.com/en/education/explore-the-benefits-of-teaching-and-learning-with-github-education/github-education-for-students/apply-to-github-education-as-a-student#applying-to-github-education) This will unlock free access to the aforementioned benefits such as GitHub Copilot. Please let the class know how this is going for you and help each other to get this benefit.

## The Assignment

Complete the [_GitHub Starter Assignment_ in our GitHub Classroom.](https://classroom.github.com/a/IbW_yY3i) This is generated and provided by GitHub. If something is unclear, please ask your instructor.
