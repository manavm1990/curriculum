## Before Getting Started

Before starting this assignment, you will need to have a GitHub account. If you don't have one, you can [create one](https://github.com/).

Just look for this "Sign Up" button in the top right ![GitHub screenshot](/img/sign-up.png)

When you sign up, you will need to use an ‚úâÔ∏è address. You can use whatever you like, but I recommend that you use your school email address. The reason why is that this may help you unlock some free features on GitHub. You can always add other identifying emails later.

Once you have your GitHub username, **please send it to your instructor.** You will be invited to join a GitHub Team for your class.

**Optional but Recommended:** You should [apply for GitHub Education.](https://docs.github.com/en/education/explore-the-benefits-of-teaching-and-learning-with-github-education/github-education-for-students/apply-to-github-education-as-a-student#applying-to-github-education) This will unlock free access to the aforementioned benefits such as GitHub Copilot. Please let the class know how this is going for you and help each other to get this benefit.

## The Assignment

### Follow a Tutorial

Simply follow this [GitHub Guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) to create a new repository on GitHub. You will be creating a new repository called `hello-world`.

### Reflection

Once you are done with this, [create a new GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/). Select the input field with the placeholder "Filename including extension...". Name your Gist something similar to what is shown below:

!['reflections-1-1.md'](/img/gist.png)

As soon as you add that file extension, `.md`, you'll notice a handy preview tab. This will allow you to see what your Markdown will look like. üéâ

In this Gist, write a reflection on your experience with GitHub. What did you learn? What was easy? What was hard? What do you think you will use GitHub for in the future?

In the same Gist, reflect on the other parts of what we did this week. How do you feel about all of the tooling that we installed and set up? Overwhelmed? Not sure? Excited? Have you used any of it before by chance?

And, finally, what about the scary terminal? How do you feel about it? Have you used it before? What do you think about it now?

Part of the purpose of writing this Gist is to practice your MD skills. The expectation is that you will use well-formatted markdown, with a single top-level heading (e.g. `# Reflections for Week 1`) and a few subheadings (e.g. `## GitHub`, `## Tooling`, `## Terminal`). You should also use lists, links, and other markdown features that you have learned about. The formatting is just as important, if not more important than the content.
