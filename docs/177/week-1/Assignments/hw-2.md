# Homework 1-2: GitHub Guide and Reflections

## Follow a Tutorial

Simply follow this [GitHub Guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) to create a new repository on GitHub. You will be creating a new repository called `hello-world`.

Upon completion, send the link to your instructor for review.

## Reflection

Once you are done with this, [create a new GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/). Select the input field with the placeholder "Filename including extension...". Name your Gist something similar to what is shown below:

!['reflections-1-1.md'](/img/gist.png)

As soon as you add that file extension, `.md`, you'll notice a handy preview tab. This will allow you to see what your Markdown will look like. ðŸŽ‰

In this Gist, write a reflection on your experience with GitHub. What did you learn? What was easy? What was hard? What do you think you will use GitHub for in the future?

In the same Gist, reflect on the other parts of what we did this week. How do you feel about all of the tooling that we installed and set up? Overwhelmed? Not sure? Excited? Have you used any of it before by chance?

And, finally, what about the scary terminal? How do you feel about it? Have you used it before? What do you think about it now?

Part of the purpose of writing this Gist is to practice your MD skills. The expectation is that you will use well-formatted markdown, with a single top-level heading (e.g. `# Reflections for Week 1`) and a few subheadings (e.g. `## GitHub`, `## Tooling`, `## Terminal`). You should also use lists, links, and other markdown features that you have learned about. The formatting is just as important, if not more important than the content.

Upon completion, send the link to your instructor for review.
