# Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a free, open-source code editor developed by Microsoft. It is one of the most popular code editors among developers due to its simplicity, speed, and powerful features. It can be customized to for use with different programming languages and frameworks, making it a versatile tool for developers. Naturally, we will be using it in this course for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

We start by installing some various extensions that we will need and introduce the possibility of using GitHub CoPilot, an AI-powered code completion tool.

As mentioned in the video also, please do not go installing other extensions outside of what we use for this course unless you really know what you are doing. Extensions can slow down your editor and cause other issues, and I won't be responsible for that. Anyone can publish an extension, so be careful.
