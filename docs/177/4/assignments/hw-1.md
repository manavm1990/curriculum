# Homework 4-1: The Web and JS Prep

1. Read **pages 1-12** of [_Eloquent JavaScript._](https://eloquentjavascript.net/Eloquent_JavaScript_small.pdf) Start with _Introduction,_ and continue on through _Code, and what to do with it._ So, you can stop when you get to _Overview of this book._
1. Read _How the Web Works_ from [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/How_the_Web_works).
1. Watch [JavaScript in 100 Seconds](https://youtu.be/DHjqpvDnNGE?si=C93ph9tcmASlaN4W) by Fireship.

## Deliverables

You know the drill. Write a well-formatted MD document that highlights want you learned from the readings and video. Now, note that I don't want to just read summaries or a regurgitation ðŸ¤® of the sources above. I already know what's in them generally and just reading the same stuff over and over for the class will just be boring!

So, although, it is necessary to summarize some of the keypoints and highlights, I want to hear your personal perspective. Was all of this totally new? What had you heard before? Did you have any preconceptions? If so, were those dispelled? What parts of the materials reminded you of any previous class? What parts interested you the most? Are there any particular analogies or comparisons you can make to help you understand the material better?

I want to hear your voice in this document. I want to hear your thoughts and opinions - that's more interesting to me than a summary. So, make sure to include those in your document.

As always, use proper headings, lists, and other formatting to make your document easy to read. And, of course, make sure to use proper grammar and spelling.

Summarily, you will submit a GitHub Gist. Or, if you want to create a full repo and then just keep multiple markdown files in there as we do more of these, that's fine too. Just make sure to submit the link to the repo or the Gist in Brightspace.
