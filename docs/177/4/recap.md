# Week 3️⃣ Recap

## Git vs. GitHub

Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in their codebase, collaborate with others, and manage their project's history. GitHub, on the other hand, is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories and provides additional features like issue tracking, project management, and collaboration tools.

### Key Differences

- **Git**: A command-line tool for version control.
- **GitHub**: A web-based platform that uses Git for version control and adds collaboration features.

### Relationship

GitHub uses Git as its underlying version control system, allowing developers to push their local repositories to the cloud, collaborate with others, and manage their projects more effectively.

## Common Git Commands

- `git init`: Initialize a new Git repository.
- `git clone [url]`: Clone an existing repository.
- `git add [file]`: Stage changes for commit.
- `git commit -m "message"`: Commit staged changes with a message.
- `git push`: Push local commits to a remote repository.
- `git pull`: Fetch and merge changes from a remote repository.

## GitHub CLI

The GitHub CLI (`gh`) is a command-line tool that brings GitHub functionality to your terminal. With `gh`, you can:

- Create and manage pull requests.
- View and comment on issues.
- Clone repositories.
- Manage workflows.

To get started with the GitHub CLI, install it from the [official GitHub CLI page](https://cli.github.com/) and authenticate with your GitHub account.
