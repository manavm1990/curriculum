# What is JavaScript?

JavaScript was first created by [Brendan Eich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich) in the mid-90s while he worked for a browser company called Netscape. There are a few different origin stories, but supposedly it was called LiveScript originally. However, because of a marketing decision, in an attempt to ride the coattails of Java it was renamed to JavaScript.

## JavaScript vs Java

üí° There is no direct association between Java and JavaScript - **they are wholly separate.** Brendan was asked to take into account the popularity of the 'hot new' Java language, so there are a few ideas from this language brought in, but, generally speaking, _Java is to JavaScript as Ham is to Hammock._

## The JS 'Sales Pitch' üï¥Ô∏è

_JavaScript(JS)_ is the most applicable, powerful and flexible language in the world today - no other language in the world allows us to work natively in the browser (client side) while also on the server (NodeJS) while also creating super-fast web-based applications (Single Page Applications - SPAs- Angular or React or Vue) while also using the same code to create native desktop applications (Electron) while also creating native mobile apps (React Native or NativeScript)!

Furthermore, very few programming languages allow as much flexibility (double-edged sword - means there is more to learn) in terms of _how_ we write our code, vis-√†-vis approaches, organization, architecture, etc. In other words, JS is a _multi-paradigm_ language.

## The JS Advantage

üí° No other programming language is 'built in' to every single web browser by default. That is the main reason why JS rules web development. This course focuses on using JS in the browser (after we learn a few programming fundamentals).

Note, that now there is Web Assembly (WASM) which is a new technology that allows us to run other languages in the browser, but it is not as widely used as JS.

## EcmaScript vs JavaScript

EcmaScript represents a 'governing body' of sorts that oversees scripting languages...at this point that pretty much just means the same as JavaScript, although, there are technically a few other scripting languages out there that are 'managed' by the [EcmaScript committee.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript) Specifically, [a group of about 50-100](https://github.com/orgs/tc39/people) good folks sit on the TC39 committee.

üí° For all intents and purposes, EcmaScript and JavaScript are used interchangeably. _Technically,_ the term 'JavaScript' is trademarked by Oracle.

We won't bog ourselves down with too many such trivialities, but it's worth noting that JavaScript as a language got a **major** overhaul in June of 2015. This came to be known as ES2015 AKA ES6. Since that time, there have been regular annual updates to the language's specification, and these have been adopted by all of the major browsers fairly quickly. These recent updates have been known as: ES2016/ES7, ES2017/ES8 and then ES2019/ES9.

Suffice to say, we will **primarily** focus on writing our JavaScript using the newest features of the language, or in other words, our code will use ES2015+ _syntax_ (a fancy word meaning the keywords and 'grammar'/structure of the way that we write our code).
