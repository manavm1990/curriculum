# Homework 5-1: Programming and JS Prep

1. Read **pages 15-31** of [_Eloquent JavaScript._](https://eloquentjavascript.net/Eloquent_JavaScript_small.pdf) Start with _Values, Types, and Operators,_ and continue on through the summary for Chapter 1.
1. Read _How JavaScript Works_ from [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript). The image below shows what parts you are expected to read. It should be the first 3 parts of the post, and this image is taken from their table of contents shown on the right of the page.

## Submission

Write a 2-3 paragraph reflection on what you learned from the readings. What was new to you? What was confusing? What did you find interesting? Submit your reflection as a well-formatted MD file, with headings, lists and maybe even some block quotes. Quality MD and personal reflections are what is needed!

Go over [the code](https://github.com/SWIC-Web-Dev/student-cards) that we demonstrated in class. In a separate MD Gist file, cite specific parts of the code and/or specific file names and jot down what you think/know about them. Include some observations about what you think will come next in the project. And include a couple of questions you have about the code or the project. This is a great way to get your brain thinking about the code and to get you ready for the next steps in the project.

For this second, separate MD file, you must use MD code snippets to get full credit! Reference [this link](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks) for help with MD code snippets.

In addition, if you are not in our ['student database'](https://github.com/SWIC-Web-Dev/student-cards/blob/main/db/db.json), DM me on Teams with your name, GitHub username and 3️⃣ fun facts about yourself. This should be done as a JSON code snippet, either with MD or just using the code snippet feature in Teams.

Summarily, **2 reflection MD Gists - one citing code snippets, and DM me a JSON snippet on Teams.**
