# Homework 7-1: JS Review

1. Write a Gist reflection on this week's lesson materials - fundamentals, âž¿s, etc. Recall that this is not just a regurgitation of the what's already there, but should include some insights and reflections from your side. This can include thoughts on what it all means, how it might be useful, your own analogies, specific points of confusion, etc.
1. Review [the code from the class about the Number Guessing Game.](https://github.com/SWIC-Web-Dev/number-guessing-game) Cite specific code snippets and give your explanation and/or interpretation. In addition, compare/contrast our in-class code with the [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/A_first_splash) implementation. How do you feel about these differences? What makes sense? What doesn't? Which do you prefer?

As a review, look over what's possible in [Markdown.](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). Try to be detailed and apply whatever you can.
