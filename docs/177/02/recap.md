# Week 1Ô∏è‚É£ Recap

## üìö Topics Covered

- Setting up the development environment with Node.js, GitBash, VS Code, and GitHub CLI
- Learning about the command line and file system navigation
- Getting familiar with Markdown

## Recap

### Node.js

Node.js allows running JavaScript on computers, enabling the execution of scripts, build tools, and servers. It will be used for running tests and local web servers.

### GitBash

GitBash is a command line shell for interacting with the computer. It facilitates file system navigation, file and directory creation, and script execution.

Key takeaways include using `cd` to start from the home directory and essential commands like `ls`, `pwd`, `mkdir`, and `touch`. Flags and options, such as `-v` and `-a`, were also introduced.

## VS Code

VS Code is the text editor for writing code. Opening VS Code from the command line with `code .` and important shortcuts like 'Ctrl + Shift + P' for the command palette and 'Ctrl + P' for file search were covered.

## GitHub CLI

Although not used yet, GitHub CLI was installed. Typing `gh` displays a list of available commands. It will be used for interacting with GitHub from the command line later in the course.

## Markdown

Markdown is crucial for writing documentation. It was used to create headings, lists, links, and images. Proper spacing is essential for correct rendering. Top-level headings start with `#`, followed by second-level headings with `##`, and so on. Only one top-level heading should be used per document.

Lists can be created with `-` or `*`, links with `[text](url)`, and images with `![alt text](url)`.

## Discussion and Opinions

We also covered some tangential topics. Note that much of the information is opinion-based and may not be universally agreed upon.

### AI and Developer Jobs

AI has raised the bar for entry-level developers. Many tasks that might have been assigned to junior developers are now handled by AI, so more is expected from individuals vying for their first positions. Unfortunately, many entry-level positions ask for 2-3 years of experience, which can be nonsensical. One way to gain experience can be through freelancing, nonprofit work, or competing for internships.

Even for experienced seniors, those without experience developing AI are at a disadvantage. However, there are still many jobs that don't require AI experience.

### AI and Coding

AI is not a replacement for coding. It is a tool that can be used to enhance coding. AI can automate tasks, such as writing parts of this curriculum.

It's better than staring at a blank screen and can sometimes be better than endless Googling. However, AI makes mistakes, especially on challenging code problems that require multiple steps. Always verify the information and think critically about it. Don't just copy and paste.

### Bootcamps

Beware of expensive boot camps. They are often not accredited, and their job placement rates are often inflated. In many cases, topics are rushed through to technically "cover" them, allowing the boot camps to check off boxes and pad students' resumes.

Many of these boot camps are for-profit and are not interested in your success. They are interested in your money.

Also, they usually don't pay instructors enough to truly attract top developer talent. Instead, those top developers are often teaching themselves and building projects. And, top developers are not always good communicators/teachers. It is difficult to find someone who is both a top developer and a top teacher.

Curriculums are usually outdated.

The best way to learn is to build projects and contribute to open-source projects. Alternatively, pursue legitimate computer science degrees from accredited universities.

Some boot camps might be free and/or sponsored by companies. One example is LaunchCode, which is sponsored by companies like Boeing and MasterCard. They are free and have a job placement rate of 90%. However, that statistic is misleading because they only accept people who are likely to succeed. And, they start with a large class of maybe 150 students, and by the end, only 30 are left. So, the 90% job placement rate is based on the 30 who are left, not the 150 who started.

### Learning to Code

Learning to code is hard. It's like learning a new language. It's not just about learning the syntax. It's about learning how to think like a programmer. It's about learning how to solve problems. It's about learning how to debug. It's about learning how to read and write code. It's about learning how to work with others. It's about learning how to learn.

Although we may use this strategy a bit less nowadays with the advent of AI, writing pseudocode before writing real code can be very helpful. It's similar to drawing a design on paper or a napkin before starting with a tool like Adobe.

It truly requires a desire to get better and to practice every day, even if it's just 15-20 minutes. It's a bit like going to the gym. One can't procrastinate and then cram in a long session once a week. It's better to do a little bit every day.

One of my favorite instructors and a former mentor of mine, Todd McLeod, says that one should code every day for at least 15 minutes. He says that if you can't find 15 minutes, you're lying to yourself. He says that if you can't find 15 minutes, you're not serious about learning to code. He says something to the effect of, "Patiently, persistently, and consistently, you will get better."

### How to Ask Questions

First and foremost, saying "I don't know!" is fine. It doesn't make you "dumb," etc. An empty glass/mind is more easily filled than a "full one."

There are definitely no "stupid questions," but there is a strategy to asking questions, whether to another person or to an AI.

1. Be specific. Don't say, "It doesn't work." Say, "I expected X, but I got Y."
2. Explain what you already tried. Based on those attempts, eliminate possibilities. Say, "I Googled it and found this, but it didn't work."
3. Isolate the problem. Try commenting out code until the problem goes away. Then, you know where the problem is.
