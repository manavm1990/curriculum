# Homework 2-1: Play Around with Tailwind CSS

## What is Tailwind CSS?

> Rapidly build modern websites without ever leaving your HTML.
> A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like `flex`, `pt-4`, `text-center` and `rotate-90` that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.
> [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

Have a look at the classes mentioned above. You can see that they are very descriptive and can be used to style your HTML elements directly in your markup. As long as you know CSS ðŸ’„, you can probably guess at what those utility classes do.

## Why Use Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework. This means that it provides you with a set of utility classes that you can use to style your HTML elements. This is different from traditional CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, which provide you with pre-built components that you can use to build your website.

To be effective at Tailwind, you do need to actually know CSS. This is because Tailwind is not a replacement for CSS, but rather a tool that helps you write CSS more quickly and efficiently.

In CSS Frameworks, CSS knowledge is not required. But, that's a tradeoff. A lot of those types of sites look the same. The ability to customize and truly make your site your own is limited.

## Overview of the Tailwind Docs
