# JSON

Markdown is a way of annotating plain text with special characters to give it meaning. However, when it comes to sharing data with machines, JSON is the preferred format.

JSON, which stands for JavaScript Object Notation, is a lightweight data-interchange format used across the web and in various programming languages. It is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is important to note that JSON is not JavaScript, but rather a notation for presenting data in a universally recognized format. It resembles JavaScript objects.

JSON has a strict syntax that uses curly braces to wrap up the data as key-value pairs. Note that keys **must be** in double quotations. The values can be in quotations if they are strings or without if they are numbers.

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "city": "New York"
}
```

JSON can be consumed in any programming language and is widely used in APIs, configuration files, and data transmission between servers and browsers. It is a fundamental concept in web development and a great starting point for learning programming and data handling.

By learning JSON, we also gain familiarity with JavaScript, which will be beneficial for future learning and development.
