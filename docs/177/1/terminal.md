# Terminal/Command Line

Computers can receive user input through either a command line interface (terminal emulator) or a graphical user interface (GUI). In a command line interface (AKA "console", "command line", "terminal", or "shell"\), the user types commands using the keyboard to tell the computer to take an action. The computer will display the results of the operation by writing text to the screen.

The terminal, also known as the command line or üêö, is a powerful tool that allows you to interact with your computer using text commands. It is essential for developers as it enables automation and efficient execution of complex operations.

As developers, we tend to use the terminal as our command center. It provides a more efficient way to control our computers through text commands, allowing us to perform tasks faster than using the graphical user interface (GUI).

Anything that can be done in the GUI can also be done in the terminal. It allows us to create, move, and delete files, as well as write scripts to automate tasks and install software.

Having a good understanding of the terminal can make you more productive and efficient as a developer, enabling you to solve problems quickly.

The terminal itself doesn't do much without a shell like Bash, which interprets and executes commands. We will introduce a few basic Bash commands that you can use in the terminal.

Technically, we are using a terminal emulator, which is a program that emulates a physical terminal inside of a 'windows manager' (like Windows, MacOS, or Linux). The terminal emulator is the program that you are using to interact with the shell. On Mac, that's Warp Terminal. On Windows, that's GitBash.

## Introduction to Bash Commands in the Terminal

### Change Directory - `cd`

The `cd` command takes you to your home directory, denoted by `~`. It is useful when you are lost or want to start over. To navigate outside the home directory, use `cd` followed by a space and the directory name as the argument.

For example, `cd Documents` takes you to the `Documents` directory, similar to double-clicking on the `Documents` folder in the GUI.

Remember to include a space as the delimiter between the command and the argument. You can save time and avoid typos by typing the first few characters and pressing `Tab` for autocomplete.

To go back up one level, use `cd ..`, which acts like a 'back button' or clicking on the 'Up One Level' folder icon in the GUI.

### List Directory - `ls`

The `ls` command lists all files and directories in the current directory, similar to opening a folder and viewing its contents.

### Make Directory - `mkdir`

Use `mkdir Code` to create a new directory called `Code`, similar to right-clicking in a folder and creating a new folder. Make sure to navigate to your home directory with `cd` before creating the new directory.

Consistency in capitalization, like using `Code` to match `Documents` and `Pictures`, is a good practice for better coding habits.

### Get a History of Commands - `history`

The `history` command displays a list of all the commands you have run in the terminal, similar to viewing your browser history. It can be useful for running previous commands again.

You can navigate through your command history using the up and down arrow keys.

### Putting It All Together

Note that commands, arguments, and flags are delimited by a space. Commands are the actions you want to perform, arguments are the data you want to act on, and flags modify the behavior of the command.

> Your entire computer can be accessed through the command line. You can do everything through the command line. It's the same computer you already know and love.

To gain a better understanding of the terminal, follow along with the videos below. If you are on Mac, use Warp Terminal (press 'command' + 'space' and search for "Warp"). If you are on Windows, use the GitBash terminal (press the Windows key and search for "GitBash").

When you first open up your terminal, you should verify that you are in your 'home' directory. You should see a `~` in your command prompt somewhere. If you don't see that, you can always type `cd` and press 'enter' to make sure that you are home.

üß† **Remember:** that you can take advantage of 'auto-completion.' This means that you can just type first few characters of a file or directory name and then press 'tab' and the command prompt will try to complete the name or at least give you a list of possible choices.

üß† **Remember:** that you can also hit the 'up arrow' to recall previously typed commands.

## Exercises

### Navigate to Directories

Open your terminal and navigate to your home directory using the `cd` command.
From your home directory, navigate to the `Documents` directory.
Try navigating to a directory of your choice and then return to your home directory.

### List Files and Directories

Use the `ls` command to list all files and directories in your home directory.
Try using ls `-a` to list all files, including hidden ones.

Try using ls `-l` to list files in long format.

Try using both `-a` and `-l` together.

### Create and Delete Files

Use the `touch` command to create a new file called `test-file.txt` in your home directory.
`rm test-file.txt`.
