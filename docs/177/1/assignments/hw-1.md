# Homework 1-1: MD and GitHub Introduction

## Before Getting Started

Before starting this assignment, you will need to have a GitHub account. If you don't have one, you can [create one](https://github.com/).

Just look for this "Sign Up" button in the top right ![GitHub screenshot](/img/sign-up.png)

When you sign up, you will need to use an ‚úâÔ∏è address. You can use whatever you like, but I recommend that you use your school email address. The reason why is that this may help you unlock some free features on GitHub. You can always add other identifying emails later.

Once you have your GitHub username, **please send it to your instructor.** You will be invited to join a GitHub Team for your class.

**Optional but Recommended:** You should [apply for GitHub Education.](https://docs.github.com/en/education/explore-the-benefits-of-teaching-and-learning-with-github-education/github-education-for-students/apply-to-github-education-as-a-student#applying-to-github-education) This will unlock free access to the aforementioned benefits such as GitHub Copilot. Please let the class know how this is going for you and help each other to get this benefit.

## Assignment

Open up your terminal. Navigate to your `Code` directory. Create a directory inside of `Code` called `markdown-practice`. Navigate to this directory. Use the `touch` command to create a new file `me.md`.

Open up VS Code using the command `Code .`. Be sure to include that `.` at the end. This will open up the current directory in VS Code.

Now, in `me.md`, write a short biography about yourself using Markdown. Include headings, lists, links, images, and any other elements you find interesting. Save the file and preview it in VS Code to see how it looks.

To preview in VS Code, you can use the `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+V` keyboard shortcut or right-click in the editor and select "Open Preview". Alternatively, use `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P` to open the command palette and search for "Markdown: Open Preview".

For the **deliverables,** you can just upload screenshots of your code and the preview into Brightspace. If you have any questions, please ask your instructor.

**Also,** please provide a screenshot of your completion of the [Markdown Tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/). This is a great way to practice your Markdown skills and learn some new tricks.

Here's a silent video of me doing something **similar** to what you are being asked to do. Note that my environment is a bit different, and you will see that some AI ü§ñ generation happening. You don't need all of that yet. More importantly, you see me create the MD file and start writing Markdown. You'll notice that I get realtime warnings from VS Code extensions about things that may not be quite right.
