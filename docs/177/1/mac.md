# Installations and Setups - Mac üçè

The videos below will walk you through the process of setting up your development environment. This part of the course is more of a 'follow the leader' format and we are not spending the time here to explain all of these tools. Just follow along as closely as you can and don't worry about understanding everything right now. We will cover all of these tools in detail later on.

The following videos will guide you on this process. Naturally, if you are not
using Mac or Linux, you can skip this step.

## Step 1: Install Homebrew üç∫ and Warp Terminal

<div class="sp-embed-player" data-id="cZVIr4VJ1bD">
<script src="https://go.screenpal.com/player/appearance/cZVIr4VJ1bD"></script>
<iframe width="100%" height="100%" style={{border: "0", width: "100%",
height: "100%"}}
scrolling="no"

## Step 2: And...It's Done After This Video

<div class="sp-embed-player" data-id="cZVIrKVJ1Fh">
<script src="https://go.screenpal.com/player/appearance/cZVIrKVJ1Fh"></script>
<iframe width="100%" height="100%" style={{border: "0", width: "100%",
height: "100%"}}
scrolling="no"
src="https://go.screenpal.com/player/cZVIrKVJ1Fh?width=100%&height=100%&ff=1" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></div>

Note that in the video I mention that I don't really use Warp, but that's now a lie ü§•. I have since started using it exclusively.

Well, this is one other video here. It just shows some of the settings that I use and mentions the AI feature in Warp Terminal. It's not necessary to watch this video, but it's here if you're interested.
