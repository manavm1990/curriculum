# Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format text in a simple and readable way. It is widely used for creating documentation, writing blog posts, and formatting README files on platforms like GitHub.

Markdown is designed to be more human-readable and easier to write compared to HTML. It shares similarities with HTML in terms of marking up text to indicate its role, such as headings, lists, and paragraphs. However, Markdown requires a Markdown processor to render the content, which is already included in VS Code.

Here are some commonly used elements in Markdown:

- Headings: Use `#` to create headings of different levels.
- Emphasis: Surround text with `*` or `_` to make it italic, and with `**` or `__` to make it bold.
- Lists: Create ordered lists using numbers followed by a period, and unordered lists using `-` or `*`.
- Links: Create links using `[link text](url)`.
- Images: Embed images using `![alt text](image url)`.

Markdown also supports advanced features like code blocks, tables, and task lists:

- Code blocks: Surround code with triple backticks (\`\`\`) to create a code block.
- Tables: Create tables using pipes (`|`) and hyphens (`-`).
- Task lists: Create task lists using `- [ ]` for incomplete tasks and `- [x]` for completed tasks.

Markdown is a versatile language that allows you to create structured and visually appealing content. It is a valuable skill for anyone involved in writing and documentation.

BTW, all of these lessons are using Markdown along with some React, but mostly Markdown! ðŸŽ‰

## Try It Out

Work through the [Markdown Tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/). It provides a hands-on introduction to Markdown syntax and features, allowing you to practice creating formatted text.

Upon reaching the end of the tutorial, you should have a good understanding of how to use Markdown to format text effectively. Please notify your instructor when you have completed the tutorial.

## Assignment

Open up your terminal. Navigate to your `Code` directory. Create a directory inside of `Code` called `markdown-practice`. Navigate to this directory. Use the `touch` command to create a new file `me.md`.

Open up VS Code using the command `Code .`. Be sure to include that `.` at the end. This will open up the current directory in VS Code.

Now, in `me.md`, write a short biography about yourself using Markdown. Include headings, lists, links, images, and any other elements you find interesting. Save the file and preview it in VS Code to see how it looks.

To preview in VS Code, you can use the `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+V` keyboard shortcut or right-click in the editor and select "Open Preview". Alternatively, use `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P` to open the command palette and search for "Markdown: Open Preview".

Once you have finished, show the file to your instructor for review.

## Conclusion

Markdown is a versatile and widely supported markup language that makes it easy to format text in a clean and readable way. By mastering its syntax and features, you can create professional-looking documentation and enhance your writing in various contexts.
