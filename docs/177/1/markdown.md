# Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format text in a simple and readable way. It is widely used for creating documentation, writing blog posts, and formatting README files on platforms like GitHub.

Markdown is designed to be more human-readable and easier to write compared to HTML. It shares similarities with HTML in terms of marking up text to indicate its role, such as headings, lists, and paragraphs. However, Markdown requires a Markdown processor to render the content, which is already included in VS Code.

Here are some commonly used elements in Markdown:

- Headings: Use `#` to create headings of different levels.
- Emphasis: Surround text with `*` or `_` to make it italic, and with `**` or `__` to make it bold.
- Lists: Create ordered lists using numbers followed by a period, and unordered lists using `-` or `*`.
- Links: Create links using `[link text](url)`.
- Images: Embed images using `![alt text](image url)`.

Markdown also supports advanced features like code blocks, tables, and task lists:

- Code blocks: Surround code with triple backticks (\`\`\`) to create a code block.
- Tables: Create tables using pipes (`|`) and hyphens (`-`).
- Task lists: Create task lists using `- [ ]` for incomplete tasks and `- [x]` for completed tasks.

Markdown is a versatile language that allows you to create structured and visually appealing content. It is a valuable skill for anyone involved in writing and documentation.

BTW, all of these lessons are using Markdown along with some React, but mostly Markdown! ðŸŽ‰
