1. Write a reflection on the ['student-cards' app code.](https://github.com/SWIC-Web-Dev/student-cards) Cite specific [code blocks](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks) in your MD. Explain what you can. List out questions for what you can't.

Open up your Dev Tools browser console and type out the following basic code examples.

1. A variable that is declared but not assigned a value (resulting in undefined).
1. A variable that is explicitly assigned the value undefined.
1. A variable that is explicitly assigned the value null.
1. An attempt to access a variable that has not been declared (resulting in a 'not defined' error).

Take a screenshot of your console and paste it into Brightspace.

Try to use either Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox Developer Edition for this assignment.
