# Homework 6-1: JS Prep

1. Write a Gist reflection on this week's lesson materials, namely just the data types and references.
1. Read [MDN's implementation of the Number Guessing Game](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/A_first_splash). Just read it and write down any relevant thoughts or reflections that you have on it. Don't actually download or write any codes. You are just to focus on their implementation and how they explain it. This is a great way to see how other people write code and how they explain it. It's also a great way to see how you can learn from others' code and explanations.

So, here, we have two MD Gists to write. One on the lesson materials, one on the Number Guessing Game, and one on the student-cards app. You can just create a single Gist, or two separate ones. Or, you can create a new 'reflections repo' and put them all in there. It's up to you. Just make sure you have all two reflections written and submitted by the due date in Brightspace.
