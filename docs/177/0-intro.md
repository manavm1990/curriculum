# Ready to Get Serious about JS and Web Development?

This course will introduce you to modern web development. We'll be using commonly used tools in professional web development, including:

- Terminal/Command Line: A text-based interface to your computer that allows you to run commands. It's similar to the Windows Command Prompt or Mac Terminal but with more features.
- VS Code: A highly customizable code editor from Microsoft. Note that this is different from Visual Studio, which is used for C# development.
- Git: A version control system that tracks changes in your codebase over time. It's like a time machine for your code and is widely used by professional developers.
- GitHub: A platform that allows you to store your code in the cloud. We'll even connect it to services like Netlify to deploy our projects live on the web with ease.

Throughout the course, we'll also enhance our skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We'll keep things realistic without getting too complex. Additionally, we'll use code quality tools such as ESLint and Prettier to help us maintain clean code. We'll also leverage AI to assist us. By the end of the course, you'll be well on your way to becoming a professional web developer. This course will prepare you to discuss technical topics confidently, which can be beneficial during future job interviews.
