# Week 1Ô∏è‚É£ Recap

## üìö Topics Covered

- We set up our development environment with:
  - Node.js (for `npm`)
  - GitBash (for...`git` and `bash`)
  - VS Code (for...writing code)
  - GitHub CLI (for interfacing with GitHub directly from the command line)
- We learned about the command line and how to navigate our file system
- We learned Markdown

## Recap

### Node.js

Although JS is a language that can run in the browser, Node.js allows us to run JS on our computers. This is important because we can use Node.js to run scripts, build tools, and even servers. We will be using Node.js to run our tests and to run a local web server.

### GitBash

`bash` is a command line shell that allows us to interact with our computer. We use `bash` to navigate our file system, create files and directories, and run scripts.

One of the most important takeaways was to use use `cd` to make sure that we are always starting from our home directory. This will help us avoid getting lost in our file system.

Other important commands we learned were:

- `ls` to list files and directories
- `pwd` to print the working directory
- `mkdir` to make a directory
- `touch` to create a file

We learned that interacting with the command line involves using commands, arguments and flags/options. During the class, we creating a new directory, `Code` with: `mkdir Code`. Then, we navigated into that directory with `cd Code`. In both of these instances we used a command and an argument.

We used flags such as `-v` to check versions of things such as `node -v` and `npm -v`. We also used flags such as `-a` to list all files, including hidden files, with `ls -a`.

## VS Code

VS Code is a text editor that we will be using to write our code. We learned how to open VS Code from the command line by typing `code .`. This opens the current directory in VS Code.

The most important shortcuts we learned were:

- 'Ctrl + Shift + P' to open the command palette. This allows us to search for commands and even note the shortcuts for them.
- 'Ctrl + P' to search for files in our project.

## GitHub CLI

We haven't used this yet, but we did install it. We can type `gh` and see a list of things that it can do. We will use this to interact with GitHub from the command line later in the course.

## Markdown

Probably the most important thing we learned was Markdown. We will be using Markdown to write our documentation, such as this document. We learned how to create headings, lists, links, and images.

Spaces matter in Markdown. For example, to create a heading, we need to have a space between the `#` and the text. If we don't have a space, then the `#` will be treated as a hash symbol. We start with a top-level heading with `#`, then a second-level heading with `##`, and so on. Just like in HTML, we should only have one top-level heading in a document.

Spaces in between lines are also important. If we don't have a space between lines, then the text will be treated as part of the same paragraph.

We can create lists with `-` or `*`. We can create links with `[text](url)` and images with `![alt text](url)`.
