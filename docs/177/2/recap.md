# Week 1Ô∏è‚É£ Recap

## üìö Topics Covered

- Setting up the development environment with Node.js, GitBash, VS Code, and GitHub CLI
- Learning about the command line and file system navigation
- Getting familiar with Markdown

## Recap

### Node.js

Node.js allows running JavaScript on computers, enabling the execution of scripts, build tools, and servers. It will be used for running tests and local web servers.

### GitBash

GitBash is a command line shell for interacting with the computer. It facilitates file system navigation, file and directory creation, and script execution.

Key takeaways include using `cd` to start from the home directory and essential commands like `ls`, `pwd`, `mkdir`, and `touch`. Flags and options, such as `-v` and `-a`, were also introduced.

## VS Code

VS Code is the text editor for writing code. Opening VS Code from the command line with `code .` and important shortcuts like 'Ctrl + Shift + P' for the command palette and 'Ctrl + P' for file search were covered.

## GitHub CLI

Although not used yet, GitHub CLI was installed. Typing `gh` displays a list of available commands. It will be used for interacting with GitHub from the command line later in the course.

## Markdown

Markdown is crucial for writing documentation. It was used to create headings, lists, links, and images. Proper spacing is essential for correct rendering. Top-level headings start with `#`, followed by second-level headings with `##`, and so on. Only one top-level heading should be used per document.

Lists can be created with `-` or `*`, links with `[text](url)`, and images with `![alt text](url)`.
