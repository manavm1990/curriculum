# JSON

Markdown is a way of annotating plain text with special characters to give it meaning. However, when it comes to sharing data with machines, JSON is the preferred format.

JSON, which stands for JavaScript Object Notation, is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is important to note that JSON is not JavaScript, but rather a notation for annotating data.

JSON has a strict syntax, with keys enclosed in double quotes and no trailing commas. Here is an example of a JSON object:

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "city": "New York"
}
```

JSON can be consumed in any programming language and is widely used in APIs, configuration files, and data transmission between servers and browsers. It is a fundamental concept in web development and a great starting point for learning programming and data handling.

By learning JSON, we also gain familiarity with JavaScript, which will be beneficial for future learning and development.
