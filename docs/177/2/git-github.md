# Getting Started with Git and GitHub

We will be using Git and GitHub to manage our code. Git is a **version control system (VCS)** that allows you to track changes in your code. GitHub is a platform that allows you to host your code and collaborate with others.

You should definitely follow along with the videos on this page, take ðŸŽ¶ and ask questions. This is critical information that we will be using for the rest of your course, and likely for the rest of your career if move on to working as a developer or engineer.

## The Terminal, VS Code and Git

In these videos, we are creating a new repository on GitHub and clone it to our local machine. However, in most cases, you will be cloning an existing repository to your local machine.

<iframe width="100%" height="100%" style={{border: "0", width: "100%",

This last video is just a quick re-introduction of VS Code.

<div class="sp-embed-player" data-id="cZVYqVVJtjj">
<script src="https://go.screenpal.com/player/appearance/cZVYqVVJtjj"></script>
<iframe width="100%" height="100%" style={{border: "0", width: "100%",
height: "100%"}}
scrolling="no"
src="https://go.screenpal.com/player/cZVYqVVJtjj?width=100%&height=100%&ff=1" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></div>

And we delve further into VS Code and, more importantly, Git.

<div class="sp-embed-player" data-id="cZVYqoVJtQD">
<script src="https://go.screenpal.com/player/appearance/cZVYqoVJtQD"></script>
<iframe width="100%" height="100%" style={{border: "0", width: "100%",
height: "100%"}}
scrolling="no"
src="https://go.screenpal.com/player/cZVYqoVJtQD?width=100%&height=100%&ff=1" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></div>

## Additional Git Commands

### `git commit`

In order to track changes to the code over time, as we work, we need to commit our changes. This is like saving a version of the code. We can then go back to this version if we need to.

<div class="sp-embed-player" data-id="cZVYq3VJtQd">
<script src="https://go.screenpal.com/player/appearance/cZVYq3VJtQd"></script>
<iframe width="100%" height="100%" style={{border: "0", width: "100%",
height: "100%"}}
scrolling="no"
src="https://go.screenpal.com/player/cZVYq3VJtQd?width=100%&height=100%&ff=1" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></div>

### `git push`

Once we have committed our changes, we need to push them to GitHub. This is like saving our changes to the cloud. It provides a backup of our code and allows us to collaborate with others.

<div class="sp-embed-player" data-id="cZVYqpVJtXD">
<script src="https://go.screenpal.com/player/appearance/cZVYqpVJtXD"></script>
<iframe width="100%" height="100%" style={{border: "0", width: "100%",
height: "100%"}}
scrolling="no"
src="https://go.screenpal.com/player/cZVYqpVJtXD?width=100%&height=100%&ff=1" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></div>

## GitHub Features

GitHub is the de facto platform for hosting code and collaborating with others. It has many features that make it easy to work with others and manage your code.

<div class="sp-embed-player" data-id="cZVYY1VJtIh">
<script src="https://go.screenpal.com/player/appearance/cZVYY1VJtIh"></script>
<iframe width="100%" height="100%" style={{border: "0", width: "100%",
height: "100%"}}
scrolling="no"
src="https://go.screenpal.com/player/cZVYY1VJtIh?width=100%&height=100%&ff=1" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></div>

## Line Endings

If you using Windows, you may run into issues with line endings. This video explains how to fix this issue. If you are on Mac, you can skip this video.

<div class="sp-embed-player" data-id="cZVTfgVJpzF">
<script src="https://go.screenpal.com/player/appearance/cZVTfgVJpzF"></script>
<iframe width="100%" height="100%" style={{border: "0", width: "100%",
height: "100%"}}
scrolling="no"

## Additional Resources

Again, this part is not required, but if you are all finished with the above materials, you can [explore a bit further](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git) instead of just wasting time. Note any interesting points that you pick up and inform the instructor for possible bonus points.
