# Recap: Programming and JS

## Programming

We leanred about what it means to program. Ultimately, we take human language and convert it into a language that computers can understand. This process is called programming. Computers are dumb, pedantic beasts that require explicit, formalized instructions. This makes programming tedious and frustrating, but also rewarding. It allows for quick execution of tasks and expands a computer's capabilities.

## What is JS?

We got a brief history of JS and its applications and dominance as the language of the web. JavaScript was first created by Brendan Eich in the mid-90s while he worked for a browser company called Netscape. There is no direct association between Java and JavaScript. JavaScript is the most applicable, powerful, and flexible language in the world today. No other language in the world allows us to work natively in the browser, on the server, create super-fast web-based applications, and use the same code to create native desktop applications and native mobile apps. JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language that allows for flexibility in how we write our code. JavaScript is built into every single web browser by default, which is why it rules web development. JavaScript is a trademarked term by Oracle, but for all intents and purposes, JavaScript and EcmaScript are used interchangeably. JavaScript got a major overhaul in June of 2015, known as ES2015 AKA ES6. Since then, there have been regular annual updates to the language's specification, known as ES2016/ES7, ES2017/ES8, and ES2019/ES9, etc. etc. etc.

### Data Types and References

We saw some simple examples of discrete data types in JavaScript, including numbers, strings, and booleans. We also saw examples of collections, including arrays and object literals. In fact, as we will learn later all collection types are objects in JavaScript. An array is just a special type of JS obejct.

We can create an object literal simply by using curly braces `{}`. Inside of here we have pairs of key-value pairs. this connects back to JSON that we saw in previous lessons.

In order to reuse any data that we create, we need to store a reference to that data. We typically use `const` to do this. We use the keyword `const` followed by a name for the reference, an equals sign, and then the data we want to reference.

With `const` this is a permanent relationsip. It's like a marriage without any possibility of a divorce. The name and the data are irrecovably linked by `=`.
